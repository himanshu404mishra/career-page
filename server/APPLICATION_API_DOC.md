# Application Management API Documentation

This document describes the endpoints for handling job applications in the Job Portal API. All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/application`.

## Endpoints

### 1. Send Application

  - `phone` (string, required, must be 10 digits)
  - `address` (string, required, min 3 chars)

- **Description:** Submits a new application for a job. Each user (by email) can apply only once per job.
- **Responses:**

## Notes
